A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation using TypeScript for interacting with an SQLite database. This server provides an interactive interface for executing SQL queries, managing database schemas, and synthesizing business insightsâ€”all within an extensible protocol framework.


## Features

Nothing implemented yet.


## How to install this locally?

TODO


## How to run it?

A docker version will be add. However, now you must do this:

```bash
npm run build  # In order to build the compiled version

node dist/index.js
```

There are some files which need the compiled version of the server, if you are trying to run a file which doesn't you can just do:

```
npx ts-node
```
